# Numerical-Analysis
I have decided to find a place for my projects of the course of Numerical Analysis, a course which was thaught at the last year of my carreer. Probably my most prolofic programs ever coded, they are an introduction to Numerical Methods for ODE.
I have to mention they were developed in Spanish, and so their comments. In case someone is interested in further explanation, everyone is able to send a message via LinkedIn.  

Also, my codes were made to "copy and paste", and their titles explain what method each represents.
